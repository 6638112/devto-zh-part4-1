I am looking for best practices for receiving zip or text files via DRF based REST based API:

*   small files < 1MB to be stored on the file system (with authentication of course)

*   traffic will start at 25 to 100 clients a day growing later

*   What responses do I send back?

*   Any Performance issues that I will have to think about?

*   How do I verify the multipart files are actually received without corruption?
