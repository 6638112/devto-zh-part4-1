找一份技术工作本身很容易，但当你试图找到一份提供异地安置的工作时，就很有挑战性了。令人惊讶的挑战，因为越来越多的欧洲科技公司转向来自世界各地的人才。

让我们来看看一些方法，你可以使用求职网站来帮助你找到工作，重新安置到欧洲。

### 电报频道

</center>

Telegram is a powerful messaging app that is very flexible in its uses. One of the things that it is used for is to communicate new job postings, website updates, or news. Several Telegram channels exist specifically for jobs that offer relocation. Here are links to the two most popular:

*   [重定位](https://t.me/relocateme)
*   [国外工作](https://t.me/jobs_abroad)

您可以通过单击链接预览每个频道，而无需加入它们。页面加载后，单击预览频道。您不需要登录或下载任何东西来查看内容。

### 科技求职板和利基网站

</center>

<center>

#### [AngelList](https://angel.co/jobs)

</center>

It's now one of the go-to websites for people looking for tech jobs at startups. To filter for IT jobs with relocation, check the **Location** tab for Europe or a specific country and then go to the **Compensation** tab. You will find a section for “**Company Will Sponsor Visa**.” Without doing this step you will find any job available that meets the other criteria you select.

#### [玻璃门](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Job/relocation-developer-jobs-SRCH_KO0,20.htm)

Glassdoor is the place to not only get the inside scoop on your future employer but also look for (tech) jobs with relocation. When you go to search for a job, type “**relocation developer**” or “**relocation**” **and the title of another tech job** that you are looking to apply to. Fill out the filters for location and other job details to narrow down where you are searching.

#### 

<center>![](img/5f01258def3dac4e749ea7a8968d6c44.png)</center>

因为 Glassdoor 没有专门针对重新定位的过滤器，所以您会发现一些不提供重新定位的工作，或者不是您在搜索结果中寻找的工作。然而，总的来说，网站在过滤他们方面做得很好。

#### [Relocate.me](https://relocate.me/?utm=5d8a09f7a8d291.98915085)

</center>

使用关键字选项卡，您可以在搜索中添加“**重新安置**或“**签证担保**”。一旦你设置好关键词，别忘了选择你想找工作的国家。以下是一些帮助您开始的链接:

*   [搬迁至波兰的开发人员职位](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=1295972748&geoId=105072130&keywords=relocation%20software%20developer&location=Poland)

LinkedIn 很棒，因为它允许你为你可能感兴趣的职位设置职位提醒。如果您想获得有关提供重新定位的职务的提醒，请确保将搜索结果顶部的职务提醒开关切换到打开状态。

### 招聘机构

</center>

Tech companies get very busy and they often outsource hiring international talent to recruiting agencies. Going through a recruitment agency can be very beneficial as a job seeker. You will be able to see many jobs from someone who will help you to find the right position for you.

除了帮助你找到合适的职位，招聘人员还能告诉你一家公司的所有相关信息。这包括公司的搬迁政策和福利。

以下是欧洲一些受欢迎的国际招聘公司:

*   [狂欢派对](http://www.rave-cruitment.com/)

### 工作搜索引擎和工作聚合器

</center>

Almost all companies have job listings on job search engines. These are job posting sites that you have probably heard of before. Turning to these sites to find a tech job with relocation in Europe can be a great idea. Because these sites aggregate jobs from around the internet, you can find a huge variety of listings on them.

看看求职搜索引擎中的三大选项。

<center>

#### [的确](https://www.indeed.com/)

</center>

Indeed is one of the big names in job searches. To find jobs on this site, you want to start by [selecting the country](https://www.indeed.com/worldwide) that you want to find employment in. Once you have chosen the country, search for “**relocation developer**” or “**relocation**” **and another job title** that you are interested in.

#### 

<center>![](img/3caebf3686bac114c2484906f879ea9e.png)</center>

这里有几个链接可以帮助你开始:

*   [搬迁至德国的开发人员职位](https://de.indeed.com/Jobs?q=relocation%20developer&vjk=bbb971f588bad0f4)

#### 

<center>![](img/ac26da53ebf4b9ca3ea8fc4dd10c502e.png)</center>

#### 

因为 Monster 没有专门针对重新安置的过滤器，所以你会发现一些不提供重新安置的工作或者不是你在搜索结果中寻找的。然而，总的来说，该网站在过滤他们方面做得很好，特别是在像德国、T2 和荷兰这样的国家，这些国家以非常吸引外来移民而闻名。

#### " T0 职业生涯"
