如果你一直在为是否给家里买一套 3D 打印机而争论不休，现在是犒劳自己的时候了！如果你需要一点推动，看看下面的原因，为什么你今天应该犒劳自己使用 3D 打印机。

#### 从长远来看，你可以省钱

You can save a surprisingly large amount of money in the long run when you use these innovative printers, all thanks to the fact that you can now create hundreds upon hundreds of different objects using printing technology. Everything from basic household items like measuring cups and bowls all the way to unique pieces of hardware can be created if you have the right materials and models.

#### 它们用起来真的很有趣

Let’s be honest—everything about using this type of printer to create your very own 3D tangible object is fun and exciting! You will be able to watch a piece you chose—whether you designed it yourself or you’re using premade models—come to life before your very eyes.

#### 你可以测试你的创造力

One of the great things about this type of printer is the fact that you can really push the limits of your creativity. You can design whatever you want, whether it’s a dinosaur shaped shower head or an elegant 18th century inspired vase or even something unique like bringing your child’s monster drawing to life as a figure. Whatever you want to make, you can!

#### 这是一项有技巧的、值得一做的爱好

It’s important to develop skills and worthwhile hobbies as a means of expanding your mind while also learning something you can use in multiple aspects of your life. Designing and/or using printing models and creating objects is a hobby that will help you stay focused and attentive from the start of the process to the very end. You could potentially use your printing and modeling skills to bring in an extra income or add it to your resume when you’re out looking for a job.

#### 它们不必再贵了

大多数人不愿购买这些产品的原因之一是 3d 打印机的成本；你需要非常富有才能买得起自己的打印机和材料的假设曾经是正确的。然而，由于打印技术的创新发展大大降低了成本，今天的 3D 打印机价格远低于几年前。这些类型的打印机现在比以往任何时候都更容易获得，你不必花费数千美元在你自己的家里拥有一台 3d 打印机。
