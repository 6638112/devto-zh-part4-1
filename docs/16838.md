So I recently started reading [CleanCode](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/) by *Robert C Martin* .
He raises some exceptionally strange points about writing professional clean code which I didn't knew at all.
Like minimising comments in our code, keeping function arguments to less than 3 and many more.

On the other hand I found this article somewhere in my social media.

[Casey Muratori on 'clean' code](http://www.opowell.com/post/casey-muratori-on-clean-code/)

I know there are tone of professionals on DEV, would like to read their insights about this 👀
