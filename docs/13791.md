👋👋👋👋

I'm back!! Sorry we missed last week, but hopefully this means we're reflecting on two weeks worth of wins!

What's something you're proud of?

All wins count -- big or small 🎉

Examples of 'wins' include:

*   Getting a promotion!
*   Starting a new project
*   Fixing a tricky bug
*   Cleaning your house...or whatever else that may spark joy 😄

Happy Friday!
