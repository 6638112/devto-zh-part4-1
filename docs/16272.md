Here are some tips while staying up-to-date with any large knowledge set, like programming, the news, or anything!

*   Watch out for overwhelm and take a break if needed
*   Recognize you can't know everything
*   Share what you're learning with coworkers and friends
*   Follow the people/groups that make you excited about the topic
*   Contribute to the conversation: write blog posts, Tweet, or record podcasts
*   Diversify your sources (one person doesn't have all the answers)
*   Automate where possible ([Feedly](https://feedly.com/) and [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/) help me)
