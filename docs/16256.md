After resetting my freeCodeCamp progress, I spent this afternoon breezing through the HTML and CSS portions of the curriculum. Once you know HTML and CSS basics, there's not really much to do but remember the syntax. So I am refreshed with my HTML and CSS. I think I might check out a CSS book to get more thorough info, but should I? Should I crowd my mind with more info just because it's an option, or should I just keep moving along with the basics?
