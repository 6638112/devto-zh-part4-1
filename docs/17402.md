# Am I too green to contribute to open-source?

I am really interested in contributing to the open source community, particularly with Mozilla. A little about me:
I am a CS student with about 1.5 years from graduating. Mozilla is my "dream job", but I am merely a beginner in the front end scene. I'd like to get ahead early but I have hesitations. Firstly, I only learned HTML and CSS this year, and I feel like I am just now starting to understand how to use both technologies. I am also new to JavaScript, most of my knowledge of it comes from freecodecamp's curriculum and a few very basic projects I have done in my own time. I seem to pick it up fairly quickly.My learning pace is a little slower than I would like, but it's largely due to balancing school life and personal projects.
I attend meetups, I read just about any book on programming I can afford to get my hands on, occasionally solve code challenges on Leetcode (which I find boring but it's how you land a job), but even with all this, I feel like I am just not "there yet". Any thoughts or pointers would help!
