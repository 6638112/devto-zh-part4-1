你有没有在一无所知的情况下努力学习一项新技能？这篇文章将向你展示一种以有趣、吸引人和令人兴奋的方式学习新技能的方法。《局外人:成功的故事》(Outliers:The Story of Success)的作者 Gladwell 解释说，达到 10000 小时的规则，他认为这是在任何领域取得成功的关键，只是练习一项特定的任务，每周工作 20 小时，持续 10 年就可以完成。然而，这种方法显然是不正确的，你需要的只是 20 个小时。你只需要分配 4 小时/天，持续 1 个月。即使在最忙碌的时间表中，如果你能每天花 30 分钟到 1 小时，坐下来最终学到你真正想学的东西，你会惊讶于你会发现什么。这个方法是由作家兼商业顾问乔希·考夫曼发现的。
该方法由 5 个简单步骤组成:

### **1-决定你到底想要什么**

This step can be really easy and hard at the same time. It depends on the level of self-awareness. In fact, if you're able to define exactly what you want to be able to do the easier it will be for you to find ways to accomplish that desire to end result as quickly and efficiently as possible.
People who "know themselves" will find it easy. Whereas, others who can't decide what they really like to do for the rest of their lives will find it really hard to choose a topic. In fact, these people will begin to work on a certain skill, once they're stuck, they will change the skill and restart from 0.
To solve this issue, try to meditate for 5 minutes, once per day for 1 week. Think of something you're really passionate about and imagine yourself in 10 or 20 years from now. Ask yourself this question: "What will I become if I master this specific skill?". Write down all the answers on a paper and read it every day. Store it on your phone or stick it on the back of your closet. This will keep you motivated and push you to make that extra step.

### **2-解构技能**

Or as I like to name it: "divide and conquer".
Most of the things that we think of as skills aren't really just one skill. As a matter of fact, they're bundles of smaller sub-skills that we use in combination with each other. For example programming, it's not just one thing. In fact, it's a bundle of all sorts of things. To master coding skill, you need to increase your critical thinking and debugging skills, learn the ins and outs of the APIs and frameworks you will be using, etc...
Same for golf, basketball, sales, and other skills.
As a result, instead of learning let's say basketball as a global skill, try to break it apart into these smaller parts and practice the most important sub-skills, the thing that you're going to use most first. That allows you to focus on the elements of practice that actually give you the performance that you're looking for. Therefore, the key is to practice the individual sub-skills

### **3-正在研究**

Research just enough that you're able to identify the most important sub-skills involved in whatever it is that you want to learn how to do, also, to understand how you will be able to self-correct as you're practicing. To do so, find three to five books, courses, [mentors or people](https://codinstyle.pro/mentors) that can help you do that initial deconstruction and understand which are the sub-skills that are going to help you to possibly master the skill as quickly as possible.
The trick is to prevent that research to become a form of procrastination in itself. The best approach is to pick 3,4 or 5 resources but don't go through the, completely. Just skim them. Catch the ideas that come up over and over and over. Those concepts and those techniques are particularly important. Those are the things that you should know in order to self-correct as you practice, and those are the sub-skills that you should probably practice first.

### **4-消除实践障碍**

Set up the environment that will actually help and motivate you to sit down and do the thing that you want to get better at it.
There are hundreds of distractions that keep you away from success. For instance, your cell phone, TV, friends, etc...
To overcome these distractions, you should turn off your cell phone, remove the distractions that can take your focus away from whatever this thing that you're trying to practice is and make sure that the time that you've set aside to practice in a way that was going to make you better is as undivided and focused as possible. Likewise, do anything you can to make it easy for yourself to practice. For example, let's say you want to learn how to use a guitar. Which is easier, to use the guitar that is just next to the chair that you usually sit on, or go to the next part of the house to pick the guitar that is in the case every time you want to practice. Therefore, by putting the guitar next to you, it will be easier for you to remind yourself that practice is a priority.
Anything you can do to remove the effort from desiring to practice to getting started is a benefit since it helps you do what you're already decided to do.

### **5-预提交**

This is a very important step. Pre-commit to at least 20 hours of focused deliberate practice before you begin. That pre-commitment is very important because it serves the purpose of deciding whether you're going to invest at least 20 hours in this skill or give up. It allows you to check up on yourself and ask yourself this question: "How important is this really?" You should know that the first few hours of practice are frustrating for everybody at the beginning of everything. By pre-commitment, you're guaranteeing to yourself that you're going to make it through those hard times where nothing is working or when you come up against an unexpected obstacle and don't know how to overcome it.
There's no magic to it. It's just focused strategic effort invested in something you care about and rewarding to yourself, and to your life.

### **结论**

The process of learning isn't difficult. However, what you're doing in this process is just removing all of the frustrations or barriers that get in your way of sitting down to the work.
