# Debugging with IEx

There are already too many articles about Debugging with IEx on the web, so I will just get to the point straight.

FYI: As per Jose, Pry is not a debugger. It just allows you to interact with a particular context. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33203676/iex-pry-going-step-by-step](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33203676/iex-pry-going-step-by-step)

# If you want to

add a breakpoint in your code: `require IEx; IEx.pry()`

continue to the next breakpoint: `continue()`

continue the execution of code without hitting any other breakpoints: `respawn()`

add a breakpoint to a function: `IEx.break!(Module, :function, arity) eg IEx.break!(String, :length, 1)`

know your breakpoints current location: `whereami`

open the code in the editor: `open()`

list out all the methods of a module: `exports(ModuleName)`

# Keep In Mind, that

*   helper functions like `continue`, `respawn`, `whereami` are only available inside pry session.

*   `whereami`, `open` won't work with precompiled source code

*   You need to configure either `ELIXIR_EDITOR` or `EDITOR` env variable for `open` to work

# Productivity

It would make your life easier if you would configure a couple of things.

*   Enabling History

If you want to have access to the commands you typed in your previous iex session, then add this `export ERL_AFLAGS="-kernel shell_history enabled"` to your `.bashrc` file and `source .bashrc`. You won't get your shell history if you had terminated the previous IEx session by pressing `Ctrl + c` two times. The right way to exit IEx session is to `ctrl g + q`

*   Customizing your IEx

You can customize your IEx by creating `.iex.exs` file. This file gets executed every time you run IEx.

My `.iex.exs` file:

```
IO.puts """
