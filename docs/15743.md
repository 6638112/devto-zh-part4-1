[PyCon UK](https://2019.pyconuk.org/) recognises that not everyone who attends their conference is doing so on the back of corporate expense accounts. I think their Individual ticket rate is a great idea and that more conferences should follow their example.

Many conferences for example still insist that you supply a company name when you attend their events, showing you who they expect their primary customers to be.
