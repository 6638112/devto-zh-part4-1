Hi There!

This is my first post. At present I am trying to build a spread sheet of people I am trying to reach by email and SMS. I mostly have contact phone numbers. What I want to do is send sms or email messages to them all at once. I need to keep track of the conversation and responses.
I am learning about google forms to collect and store data.
I think I need to turn my website into a membership site. Thinking of using membership.io....

This looks like a fun community I'm looking forward to getting involved!

Best Regards,

Simon.

....you can probably tell that I've been around a while now. I started with pen, paper and stamps...
