# Gatsby - CSS Starters Speed Test

Hello coders,

Making fast websites is hard. Personally, for some projects, I was spending a few days to optimize the web app before releasing into the wild. That was OK because I was familiar with the technique of following 30 item performance checklists and getting an 85 Lighthouse Score at the end.

Now, I'm using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), mainly for three reasons:

*   Apps built with [Gatsby are fast](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-09-13-why-is-gatsby-so-fast/). If you choose randomly any [Gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2) and make a speed test, there are big chances to score more than 85 on Lighthouse, without touching the app code.
*   Gatsby uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) to code the pages.
*   The [tooling](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-core-philosophy/#gatsbys-tooling-philosophy), **Gatsby** concepts and, great [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

In this article, I will present a few [GatsbyJS apps](https://appseed.us/apps/gatsbyjs) that I've played with before choosing my next CSS Framework, looking at the app speed, as a first metric.

### [](#some-of-my-conclusions)Some (of my) conclusions

Based on the numbers, Tailwind gets the maximum score, but .. we must take into account the fact that apps are showing different content. For instance, the SCSS **Gatsby** starter display video content, using the HTML **video** tag, unoptimized (from what I know) by **Gatsby**.

A real benchmark should use the same page structure with a repetitive load test, using the same server infrastructure (this requirement is met, all apps are running from the same server). My personal choice was [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) because they are damn hot compared to the heavier Bootstrap. For me, hot means:

*   modular
*   lightweight
*   no javascript dependency
*   a growing community around the framework
