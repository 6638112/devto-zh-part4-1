# Are you aligned with your team on a shared vocabulary?

Communication is critical to the success of a team and having a shared vocabulary is an important part which helps teams communicate effectively, move forward faster, and build trust within and across teams. When there isn't a common understanding of the vocabulary there is ambiguity, misunderstanding, and confusion.

One word can mean different things to different people because of factors such as:

*   age
*   culture
*   experience
*   knowledge
*   education

Vocabularies can be related to the team, company, product, or even industry which you work in.

* * *

## Your Challenge:

1.  Name 5 words which your team must have a shared understanding of?_
2.  Share your 5 words with your team to see if everyone is on the same page about the meanings for those words.

* * *

I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

Cheers! :)
