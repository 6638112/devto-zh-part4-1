This article is only focused on building a blockchain application using one of Hyperledger projects. I briefly survey each project followed by its hands-on recipes. Also, if you wish to learn and practice Ethereum blockchain development, visit [Comprehensive Ethereum Training Tutorials](https://myhsts.org/tutorial-comprehensive-blockchain-ethereum-and-solidity-developer-guide-for-all-professional-programmers.php) page to get the outline of our Ethereum tutorial articles.

**Note:** Good knowledge of blockchain concepts, JavaScript and Python as well as basic skills in Linux OS are required in order to complete tutorials listed on this article.

[Here](https://learn.coding-bootcamps.com/blog/202224/why-build-blockchain-applications-with-hyperledger-fabric) is a good article on why choosing Hyperledger Fabric over other blockchain development platforms.

**Overview of Hyperledger Project and Family**
Hyperledger project is made of many frameworks and tools.
**Hyperledger Project Frameworks**
The frameworks under Hyperledger project aim to provide platforms to build a variety of distributed ledgers and their components. They are as follows:

*   **Hyperledger Fabric**: Fabric is the most popular Hyperledger framework. Smartcontracts (also known as **chaincode**) are written in Golang and JavaScript, and run in Docker containers. Fabric is known for its extensibility and allows enterprises to build distributed ledger networks on top of an established and successful architecture.
*   **Hyperledger Sawtooth**: Sawtooth is the second project to reach 1.0 releasematurity. Sawtooth-core is written in Python, while Sawtooth Raft and Sawtooth Sabre are written in Rust. It also has JavaScript and Golang components. Sawtooth supports both permissioned and permissionless deployments. It supports the EVM through a collaboration with the Hyperledger Burrow.
*   **Hyperledger Burrow**: Burrow is the first permissioned ledger that supportsEVM. It is written in Go and heavily focuses on being a deterministic Smart Contract engine.
*   **Hyperledger Indy**: Indy is built explicitly for decentralized identitymanagement. The server portion, Indy node, is built in Python, while the Indy SDK is written in Rust. It offers tools and reusable components to manage digital identities on blockchains or other distributed ledgers.
*   **Hyperledger Iroha**: Iroha is designed to target the creation and management ofcomplex digital assets and identities. It is written in C++ and is end user friendly. Iroha has a powerful role-based model for access control and supports complex analytics.

Below graph succinctly depicts Hyperledger frameworks and tools.

For learning more about Hyperledger project tools and Hyperledger family the following articles are strongly recommended. [Intro to Hyperledger Family and Hyperledger Blockchain Ecosystem](https://weg2g.com/application/touchstonewords/article-intro-to-hyperledger-family-and-hyperledger-blockchain-ecosystem.php) and [Hyperledger Design Philosophy and Framework Architecture](https://weg2g.com/application/touchstonewords/article-overview-of-hyperledger-design-philosophy-and-framework-architecture.php) .

**I- Hyperledger Fabric Project and Development**
It is out of question that Hyperledger Fabric is currently the most popular platform for blockchain development. Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade platform that leverages a highly-modular and configurable architecture. Hyperledger Fabric is optimized for a broad range of industry use cases, including the finance, banking, healthcare, insurance, and public sectors, as well as supply chains and digital asset management. Read below article to learn about Hyperledger Fabric architecture and design:
[https://weg2g.com/application/touchstonewords/article-the-survey-of-hyperledger-fabric-architecture-and-components-for-blockchain-developers.php](https://weg2g.com/application/touchstonewords/article-the-survey-of-hyperledger-fabric-architecture-and-components-for-blockchain-developers.php)

We have written two sets of tutorials to explore Hyperledger Fabric in depth. First set covers the following six recipes:
It starts with [installing Hyperledger Fabric on an AWS EC2 virtual machine](https://myhsts.org/tutorial-learn-how-to-install-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric-on-amazon-web-services.php),  [setting up the first Hyperledger Fabric network](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/building-hyperledger-fabric-network-for-blockchain-applications/) and [working with Hyperledger Fabric Command Line Interface or CLI](https://myhsts.org/tutorial-learn-how-to-work-with-hyperledger-fabric-cli-to-setup-network-and-manage-chaincode.php). We learn the following:

*   Generating the crypto/certificate using cryptogen
*   Generating the configuration transaction using configtxgen
*   Bring up the nodes based on what is defined in the docker-compose file
*   Using the CLI to set up the first network
*   Using the CLI to install and instantiate the chaincode
*   Using the CLI to invoke and query the chaincode

We move on to show you how to [Add New Network to a Channel](https://myhsts.org/tutorial-learn-how-to-add-organization-to-channel-in-hyperledger-fabric.php), [Use CouchDB as a State Database for Hyperledger Fabric](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/use-couchdb-as-a-state-database-for-hyperledger-fabric/), and [Create a Smart Contract and then Deploy it into the Blockchain](https://myhsts.org/tutorial-learn-how-to-write-first-blockchain-application-in-hyperledger-fabric.php).
In short, in first 6 recipes, we learn about how to set up and configure Hyperledger Fabric. We explore its key components, including channels, **Membership Service Providers** (**MSPs**), the ordering service, and Fabric **Certificate Authority** (**CA**).
The second set, we will show you how to build a simple device asset management DApp. It consists of 6 recipes as follows:

*   [Reviewing of inventory asset management and chaincode](https://myhsts.org/tutorial-learn-how-to-implement-hyperledger-fabric-via-inventory-asset-management-application.php)
*   [Writing chaincode as a smart contract using Go](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/writing-hyperledger-fabric-chaincode-using-go-programming-language/)
*   [Compiling and deploying Fabric chaincode](https://myhsts.org/tutorial-learn-learn-how-to-compile-and-deploy-hyperledger-fabric-chaincode-and-smart-contracts.php)
*   [Running and testing the smart contract](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/running-and-testing-smart-contracts-for-hyperledger-fabric/)
*   [Designing front-end of an application with Hyperledger Fabric through the SDK](https://myhsts.org/tutorial-learn-learn-how-to-design-front-end-application-with-hyperledger-fabric-through-sdk.php)
*   [Developing back-end of an application with Hyperledger Fabric through the SDK](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/developing-backend-application-with-hyperledger-fabric-through-sdk/)

In summary, in the second set of recipes, we are going to build a simple device asset management DApp. We will exploit this example by writing chaincode implemented by various programming languages and we'll also build, test, and deploy our DApp.
