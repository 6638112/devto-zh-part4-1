# A VS Code Extension for Managing Profiles

Part of my job as a Cloud Developer Advocate is to present, whether that is at a lunch and learn session, a user group, a conference or a screen cast. One thing that‚Äôs become second nature to me with presenting is tweaking my editor font size, theme, etc. so that it is optimal for the audience. But this becomes a bit tedious, because I then have to go back and undo all my changes again and the constant change back and forth is annoying.

So with that I decided to create an [extension for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension?wt.mc_id=devto-blog-aapowell) called [Profile Switcher](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaronpowell.vscode-profile-switcher).

## [](#how-it-works)How It Works

When you save a profile with the extension it will create a copy of the `settings.json` file that exists for your user (on Windows this is `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json`) and then store it in the `settings.json` file in settings property that the extension knows about.

*Side note: It doesn‚Äôt clone the extension settings, just everything else, wouldn‚Äôt want you to have recursive settings saved!* ü§£

Then when you load the a profile it will merge your current `settings.json` with the previously saved one, updating the properties that are different (and not touching the ones that didn‚Äôt change). Because it updates your user `settings.json` all open VS Code instances will have the changes applied, handy if you‚Äôre running demos across multiple VS Code instances!

A nifty side-effect of how this works is that if you‚Äôre using the [Settings Sync extension](https://dev.to/scottw/vscode-settings-sync-4d27) your profiles will be synchronised with that, so when you jump between machines you can bring your profiles along with you!

This also means that it‚Äôs not just for presenting, it‚Äôs for any scenario where you might want to quickly jump between settings changes in VS Code.

## [](#conclusion)Conclusion

I hope you find this extension useful and I‚Äôve love to get some feedback on what it could also be used for. I‚Äôve made the code available [on GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpowell/vscode-profile-switcher) so you can create an issue for me or propose an update. üòÅ

This extension allows you to define a number of settings profiles that you can easily switch between. The original idea for this extension came from my desire to have an easy way for me to switch my VS Code to a setup that was better optimised for presenting (changed themes, increase font size, etc).
