More often developers need to share ideas and engage with other developers. I found this overwhelming and wanted to share alittle about technology hubs in Kenya.
I have found some time and visited some of this area's and attended bootcamps and Hackathon in Kenya.
I will list some of the technology hubs (places)where one can visit.
First on my list is.
1.Ihub -located in the country's capital Nairobi,it offers a cool environment and not to mention the high speed WiFi provided at the place.
2.Eldohub located in Eldoret just away from the busy town.Personally I have visited this place.
3.Lakehub located in Kisumu. It provides developers with free internet connection and the location is near the town so you can grab a coffee when you feel alittle wasted.
For other locations you can follow the link below.
