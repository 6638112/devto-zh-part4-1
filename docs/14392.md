Around a year ago, I was chatting with a good friend about an idea I had for a podcast. Over the last several years, I've learned that I've become really focused on improving existing software over building something new.

I'm not [a maker](https://medium.com/@robbyrussell/herzogs-cave-of-forgotten-code-432f73cf1903). That is somewhat true, I prefer to spend more of my time improving something than making something from scratch.

The concept for the [Maintainable podcast](https://maintainable.fm) was to challenge myself with finding a diverse collection of experienced professionals from our industry--and to hear their stories about how they played a part in improving existing software.

While we, as an industry, are creating a ton of new things -- we also need to be focused on making the existing things better today than we found them yesterday. We don't need to label this as "legacy code"--it's just code.

As of today, my team has helped me publish 13 episodes (with several more on the way). I've had an opportunity to speak with people like:

*   [Charity Majors](https://maintainable.fm/episodes/charity-majors-deploys-are-just-the) of Honeycomb who thinks we need to spend more time "testing" in production.
*   [Eileen M. Uchitelle](https://maintainable.fm/episodes/eileen-uchitelle-upgrading-ruby-on-rails) of GitHub on how to tackle a large Ruby on Rails upgrade.
*   [Matt Weagle](https://maintainable.fm/episodes/matt-weagle-what-will-it-enable-us-to-do-in-the-future), Engineering Manager at Lyft on coaching developers on how to better discuss technical debt
*   [Coraline Ada Ehmke](https://maintainable.fm/episodes/coraline-ada-ehmke-the-role-of-empathy-in-engineering-teams), Principal Engineer at Stitch Fix on the role of empathy in the workplace
*   [Pim Elshoff](https://maintainable.fm/episodes/pim-elshoff-refactoring-how-engineers-c) a software developer at Procurious about communication tactics within technical teams
*   ...and several other people that I have learned a lot from.

Have you heard any of the episodes yet? (and find value in it?) If so, it would mean the world to me if you could take a moment to [add a rating on Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintainable/id1459893010). ðŸ˜Š

if you haven't, I invite you to listen to an episode or two at [Maintainable.fm](https://maintainable.fm/).
