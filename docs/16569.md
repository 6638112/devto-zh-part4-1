During #DevDiscuss last night, we discussed resumes! I posed this question, which received more attention than expected:

Liquid error: internal

So being the math-minded person that I am, I started to wonder what the responses would look like in a Pie chart (OK, maybe I also wanted a reason to play with Affinity Designer).

[![Pie Chart showing the statistics: 22% Latex, 10% Google Drive, 9% HTML & CSS, 8% Word/Pages, 6% Canva, 5% Indesign, 5% LinkedIn, 3% Markdown, and 28% Other ](../Images/f7a966c0d01903d347af8fcfad4553a9.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bSA7XonG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/pfp1a5qa92vfnd41v1mr.png)

My quick notes about the data:

*   At the time of review, I pulled 207 responses indicating a resume creation tool of choice.
*   Latex was a VERY popular response. I suspect this is higher within the developer community than outside it.
*   Personally, I never would have thought to use tools like Illustrator/Canva, but many others have! I loved the variety of responses received - There are so many interesting tools out there for resume generation.
