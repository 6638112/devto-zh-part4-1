Last week I completed my first presentation on cloud computing. This session in particular focused on how cloud computing can help small businesses operate more efficiently and effectively. The technology also allows organizations to grow by focusing on their products and services and not the technology needs.

I focus on three cases studies of businesses that use the cloud - SmugMug, Zillow and Lyft.

Points that I focus on:
Reliability
Availability
Reduce latency time
Cost savings with auto-scaling

When preparing for this presentation I had a goal of being informative but not instructional. I couldn't resist ending the presentation sharing how Amazon Web Services is providing resources like AWS Educate CSforALL and Girls Who Code
