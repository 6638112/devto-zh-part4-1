# [](#paint-and-draw)Paint and Draw

I made this project a while back. I always enjoy using the native functionalities of JavaScript to develop my projects. This one is no different. I was bored in class and decided to do something fun. I end up making this very simple app. Since I liked it a lot, I decided to upload it to GitHub and maybe work on it a little bit more latter on.

Hope you like it to.
