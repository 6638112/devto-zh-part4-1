The Cloud Native Computing Foundation is a non-profit organization that hosts Kubernetes, Prometheus, CoreDNS, and other projects. The Foundation helps open-source projects to thrive, and their Community Infrastructure Lab (CIL) provides free access to state-of-the-art computing resources (like bare metal x64 and arm64 servers) for open source developers working to advance cloud native computing. [CNCF members](https://www.cncf.io/about/members/) from many big companies makes providing bare metal servers possible. CNCF is one of the Linux Foundation's largest sub-foundations. More info at [CNCF FAQ](https://www.cncf.io/about/faq/) and interview at [FLOSS Weekly 452](https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/452).

## [](#x64-platforms-status-20190630)x64 platforms status 2019-06-30

*   **Source install**: Works on x64, available for [Meteor 1.6.x](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/master/rebuild-wekan.sh) and [Meteor 1.8.x](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/meteor-1.8/rebuild-wekan.sh) versions.

*   **Ubuntu Snap**: [Works on x64 Linux](https://github.com/wekan/wekan-snap/wiki/Install). Uses Meteor 1.6.x, because of build problems of Meteor 1.8.x.
*   **Sandstorm**: [Works on x64 Linux](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Sandstorm). Because I enabled multiple boards for Wekan, [there is still related bugs](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sandstorm+label%3ATargets%3ASandstorm), that I will fix.

## [](#arm-platforms-status-20190630)ARM platforms status 2019-06-30

*   I did get [ARM etc bare metal access](https://github.com/cncf/cluster/issues/45#issuecomment-356150118) from CNCF.
*   Server ARM 64bit, more specifically arm64 / **aarch64** with about 125 GB RAM and 300GB harddisk.
*   Server had Debian 9, now it has Ubuntu 18.04 64bit.
*   I got Wekan [working on RasPi3 and arm64 server yesterday 2019-06-29](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Raspberry-Pi) using Meteor bundle.

## [](#future-plans)Future plans

## [](#what-cncf-servers-have-enabled-to-do)What CNCF servers have enabled to do

### [](#status-20190630)Status 2019-06-30

*   Release new version of Wekan max 7 times a day ([see ChangeLog](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)), on those days when there is a lot of progress. I (xet7) connect x64 server using virt-manager (uses ssh+vnc transport), so I see desktop running at server. There I have installed many Linux VMs for different distros, and do Wekan development. Currently I use arm64 server that has about 128 GB RAM and 300GB SSD, and x64 server that has about 300 GB RAM and 2 TB NVME disk.
*   Build Wekan, Sandstorm, Friend, etc Open Source projects on that hardware, and enabling the current fast progress of Wekan.
*   x64 server has Wekan Snap installed, that incudes Caddy and Wekan. So [https://releases.wekan.team](https://releases.wekan.team) release download server is served by Wekan snap on CNCF server.
*   On arm64 server, I got Wekan [working on RasPi3 and arm64 server yesterday 2019-06-29](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Raspberry-Pi) using Meteor bundle.
