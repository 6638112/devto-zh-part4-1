When troubleshooting logs that a program can output, you need to find out which file is the latest output log of this program.

After preliminary lsof -p xxx -Pn determines the log used by the program, use:

Xxx-type f-name' *. log'-printf'% t @% p \ n' | sort-n
Get the latest output log file in the log directory.
