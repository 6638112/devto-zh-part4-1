For a long time I have been focused on front-end development. I follow a lot of high profile people on social media. I also read blogs and sometimes newsletters. My focus is slowly shifting from front-end to back-end development. At my job, we write a lot of Scala and Java. I really want to become better at these languages.

Do you know any high profile Scala or Java developers?
Can you recommend any good blogs on these languages?
