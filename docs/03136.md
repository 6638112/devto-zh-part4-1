# 你问这些问题是为了扩大你的名单吗？

什么是个人广告，为什么你需要他们来发展你的业务？Solo 广告是基于电子邮件的广告，您可以从其他电子邮件列表所有者那里购买。他们是这样工作的:你找到一个你感兴趣的广告单。您可以联系所有者或从他们的网站购买访问列表的权限。你要么根据你的电子邮件将被发送给多少订户来购买，要么根据你的电子邮件将获得多少点击来购买。如果一切顺利，这些订户会点击，而这些点击会很好地转化。

### **如何开始做 solo 广告？**

一个不能开始的地方是廉价广告。你或许可以在 ClickBank 或 Udimi 上花 5 美元购买 1 万封电子邮件，但不太可能看到任何投资回报。廉价的个人广告提供商经常通过搜集电子邮件来建立他们的“名单”。受众没有选择加入，没有购买意向，很可能会将你的邮件视为塞满他们收件箱的又一封垃圾邮件。

但是，如果你准备花一点钱在真正的买家面前得到你的报价，第一步显然是找到合适的租赁清单。做到这一点的一个方法是在互联网上搜寻你所在领域的有影响力的人，并直接向他们推销你的想法。

Udimi 和 Clickbank 提供单独广告，但你在选择合适的列表时应该非常小心。一旦你选择了某人的清单，试着和他/她建立良好的关系并向他/她学习。

以下是我建议询问的一些问题:

### 你的名单上有多少人？

This question will give you a quick overview of the number of people that will see your ad/email. A big email list doesn't necessarily mean a good sign. In fact, someone may have a list of 100000 subscribers but they no longer open their emails or the emails go straight to the people's junk folder. Thus, just because someone has a big list doesn't mean that you know that you're going to make a lot of money with it. Besides, if someone has a small list, it doesn't mean it's a bad thing if they've got a good relationship with that list.

### 你能发送多少次点击？

If somebody is charging per click then that would be a great question to ask. If they're saying that they can deliver a hundred thousand clicks, well that's a good sign because you know because that tells me that this guy's got a big list and it's very responsive. Start small first. In fact, ask them for the smallest package, if all goes well and you made some cash, get back to them and ask for a bigger package, let's say 20000 clicks or 50000 or now let's just send an e-mail out to everybody on your list. So it's really easy to scale and get a lot more traffic.

### 你的费用是多少？(每封邮件/点击)

You may want to ask them what their rates are if they don't tell you upfront or if they don't have it on their sales page. If I'm contacting somebody out of the blue and they say that "yes they can do a solo ad", I could just ask them "what would you charge for that?". If I'm contacting random dog training product owners I can just hit up people that dog blogs and ask them to send an e-mail to their subscribers for X dollars.

### 你是如何建立你的清单的？

One of my favorite questions! This is a big question that I do like to ask just about every person that has an email list, no matter how big or small their email list is. Because this can be a deal-breaker.

有些人可能会说:“我是从发送垃圾邮件的人那里建立我的列表的”或者“我是从未经他们允许的情况下从 Craigslist 上随机获取人们的电子邮件地址建立我的列表的”或者“我是从一堆免费优惠券中建立我的列表的”或者如果他们说“我是从购买过我的产品的人或者到我们商店购买我们的产品的人那里建立我的列表的”或者“我是从付费流量中建立我的列表的”。这个答案给了你一个很好的信号，告诉你向他们索要个人广告是好是坏。

### 在你的清单中，什么样的优惠最有效？

Here's another really great question that I would definitely ask people before signing up with them. These people know they send out lots of things to their list all the time so they know what works and what doesn't.

他们可能会说他们的清单喜欢电子产品和小玩意。然后，也许我会想为他们创造另一个免费赠品。这是我会做的事情，因为我知道他说这与他的清单非常吻合。

### 你对我的 squeeze 页面有什么建议/提示吗？

This can save you a lot of headaches. Ask him/her if he/she thinks that your offer will do well.
It's a good idea to always ask these guys for suggestions and tips on your page. If they're successful and they do a lot of mailings then they can sometimes offer really great tips and advice that can help you tweak your page and make it even better.

### 你能推荐其他人一起做个人广告/时事通讯吗？

This question will guide you to another successful solo ad. Maybe after you buy a solo ad from them and if you have good experience with them or maybe even ask them before your call OK. Ask people in the niche who would they recommend, and they can tell you some of their best sources.

### **结论**

For some businesses, solo ads work great. They’re an affordable way to build a list fast or to blast exposure for a product launch. But there are some stories of people getting burned.

我给你的建议是慢慢开始。把你的登陆页给亲戚朋友看看，看看是否需要修改。完成修改后，在 3-5 个列表中测试它，并跟踪它以查看转换的百分比。
