When I'm working on a side project, I always have the moment where I think about things which prevent me from continue working on the project.

This are mostly totally irrelevant things like legal things (in Germany a website needs an imprint, data privacy statement, ...), which are not worth thinking about in such an early state.

I do also often delete all my source code and start from scratch when it comes to designing things.

What are your struggles and do you maybe have some advices how to keep them aside?
