Have a look at the following code sample:

```
data.course.enrolments.forEach(enrolment => enrolment.confirm()) 
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Sometimes the data we work with is not predictable, so to avoid errors or crashes we always have to take care of edge cases. The above code makes a lot of assumptions. It assumes that `data.course` exists, `data.course.enrolments` exists and is an array of objects with a `confirm` property which is a valid `Function`.

If the `data.course` or `data.course.enrolments` property is `undefined` we get the following `TypeError` error:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property enrolments of undefined
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property forEach of undefined 
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

If the `confirm` property in each `enrolment` object in the `data.course.enrolments` array is not a valid `Function`, we get the following error:

```
Uncaught TypeError: enrolment.confirm is not a function 
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Now have a look at this one:

```
((data.course || {}).enrolments || [])
    .forEach(enrolment => enrolment.confirm && enrolment.confirm()) 
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

I'll explain how the above snippet works.

#### `data.course || {}`

This expression resolves to `data.course` if the `course` property exists on the `data` object, and resolved to an `{}` if it doesn't. The reason it resolves to `{}` is because of the `||` operator which checks if the left-hand side of the expression (`data.course`) is `falsy`, and if it is, resolves the expression to the right-hand side (`{}`). If it's not `falsy` then it resolved the expression to the left-hand side.

#### `(data.course || {}).enrolments || [])`

As explained above, the left-hand side will either be `data.course` or `{}`. Next, we try to access the `enrolments` property on the object resolved from the first expression.

#### `enrolment.confirm && enrolment.confirm()`

Unlike the `||` operator, the `&&` checks if the left-hand side of the expression (`enrolment.confirm`) is `truthy`, and if it is, resolves the expression to be the right-hand side (`enrolment.confirm()`). This means the function `enrolment.confirm` will never be executed if the `confirm` property is not found on the `enrolment` object.

#### Summary

Taking care of edge cases as you write your code can save you a lot of debugging time, and also prevent unexpected application crashes.
