# WSL as a proxy server.

I have a Windows (10) application that has a UDP interface only. But I need to connect to a device that accepts only telnet connections. I wrote a Python program that creates a telnet client and automatically connects to a telnet server. I was wondering if it was possible to run my Python program in WSL to make the telnet connection, create a UDP socket (to Localhost?), and then use my Windows program to connect to that - which would give me the connectivity that I need.
