# Podcasts. How? Why? And When?

> 原文：[https://dev.to/christopheek/podcasts-how-why-and-when-1no](https://dev.to/christopheek/podcasts-how-why-and-when-1no)

So my morning routine is all about reading articles while having my cup of coffee before I start coding, and I almost always read the word `podcast` in arguably every article.

A lot of people listen to podcasts. But I've never known why.

So here's a question for everyone willing to help me out.

Why the heck would I listen to 1-hour-long podcasts? And where would I do that? Is it possible for me to do it while coding? What are they usually about? Seriously. Just, like. Help pls.
