# What Do Web Developers Need To Know About HTTP/HTTPS?

In the [Web Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) and other sources, it's said that web developers should have some working knowledge of HTTP. I find the scope of this subject hard to parse, and am wondering what folks think webdevs need to know about HTTP, apart from [status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) and [request methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods)?
