## Was it worth it?

Hell yeah, the **smile and proudness** I saw on my **mom and dad** faces was totally worth it.

University is not just about courses and instructors, I believe it's much more than that.

> Yes, you won't learn much from your university courses...
> But you will meet a bunch of great people out there!

I met there in the university lots of awesome people, one of them is the co-founder of our online programming academy, [Coretabs Academy](https://coretabs.net).

Aside from that, living abroad in a foreign country is the best instructor you could ever get.

Living abroad teaches you tons of stuff... the top things I got from that are:

1.  Discovering who I am.
2.  Having a solid independent personality.

If you haven't been living abroad, do yourself a favor and **GO DO IT**.

If you think about the university program itself would help you, you're wrong... very very wrong.

#### Fun Fact

The course I've learned the most from is **Accounting**, which is a university elective course that comes along the Computer Engineering program.

## It won't make any difference in your life

You heard that right, it's never gonna make any difference if you get better grades... cuz yeah, **nobody cares**.

People will applause so hard for you with the fact that they understand that university system is very broken.

I would say I **owe** the money that I paid for university to: **Pluralsight, TeamTreehouse, and YouTube**.

Those are the places where I really learned core tech skills that correspond with the actual market needs.

#### Fun Fact

My attendance on most courses = **ZERO**

I just spent the time working (remotely).
And of course, I attended the quizzes, labs, and exams to never fail a course.

I'm not saying that to brag,
I'm saying that to prove one simple thing: you can learn all university topics on your own.

## What would I do next?

Here is my answer loud and clear: **I DON'T KNOW!**

Seriously, I don't know what path to take in the next 5 years.

But, I definitely know that I would take the most useful path in my future.

At least, I know what to do in the next couple of months.

It's gonna be making [Coretabs Academy](https://coretabs.net) providing better services/experience for its users.
