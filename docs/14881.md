What makes you shake your head on how your manager or team or company manage work/project at your workplace. What things or practices will you change if you get the chance.

What does your ideal workplace will look like?

Some of the things that bother me-

*   Lack of trust on employee
*   Not enough transparency on decisions or policies
*   Constant interruption. Always be present or response at real time, no opportunity for deep concentrated work.
*   Punishing everyone for one individual wrongdoing.
*   Unnecessary meetings

Please, share your experience and opinions on this matter.
