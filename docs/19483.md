Macros in Laravel are something that I think are still not talked about enough in the framework. They’re really power and really useful. I don’t think there’s a project I’ve created in the last year or two that isn’t using a macro somewhere.

To cover what a macro is briefly, it’s a way of extending a class’ methods but without using inheritance and instead it works by adding a Closure to a class. This then means that all instances of that class has that newly added method. Any class that has uses the Macroable trait found in the Laravel framework can have macros applied to them.

In this article I want to cover a range of simple use cases that will improve things for you, reducing duplicating code, making code more readable or simply getting around problems you might have in testing.

### How to make them and where to put them

This isn’t an obvious thing from the get go. There’s one of two places I would advise putting your macros. The first is by using a simple PHP file loaded up via Composer. I generally make this new file in the app folder and call it macros.php Then you simply edit the autoloader key in composer.json to have a files property and within that array list you should add the relative path to the fileapp/macros.php. This then just requires running composer dump-autoloader so the newly added file will be loaded and executed at runtime, setting up our macros for the entire application.
