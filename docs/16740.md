# What Does Gatsby Mastery Look Like?

Few web dev technologies sparked joy for me like Gatsby, and I've been thinking about what real mastery in the framework looks like. The obvious things to me seem like:

*   Deep comfort with Reach Router and which of it's features can save work in certain instances.

*   Understanding what sort of query (static vs page) to use and when.

Some things I wonder about:

*   Which plugins one needs to know forwards and backwards, versus just looking up when the use case for it comes up.

*   Are there React features we're better off not using in Gatsby?

Are you or somebody you know an expert in Gatsby? What does expertise in the framework look like to you?
