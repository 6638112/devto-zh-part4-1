# If you are front-end dev - how do you keep yourself concentrated on grooming when BE guys discuss their technical details?

The problem is that I start dreaming if BE is being discussed more than 5-7 min, since I our BE implementation not an easy one and I cannot help BE guys or get into discussion. And since I am dreaming I often got cought by scrum-master that I miss something when BE are done and we start some FE discussion.
Any ideas?
