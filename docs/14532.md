# Best DEV.to Posts for Beginners: Week of July 1, 2019

> ÂéüÊñáÔºö[https://dev.to/desi/best-dev-to-posts-for-beginners-week-of-july-1-2019-24n6](https://dev.to/desi/best-dev-to-posts-for-beginners-week-of-july-1-2019-24n6)

One of the reasons I've been so drawn to DEV.to over other platforms is the super encouraging and helpful community that gathers here. Initially I felt like it was going to be more a place where I sat back and watched, rather than write and contribute, but I've been so pleased to find not only helpful articles and tutorials that I understand, but also that input from new coders and devs is well-received.

I thought it would be nice to compile some of the best posts every week for those of us who still identify as #codenewbies!

As you'll remember, I love CSS - [@lampewebdev](https://dev.to/lampewebdev) 's CSS Quickies series makes me really happy! I use `border-radius` frequently.

A lot of developing - writing code, programming, designing UI/UX - involves being uncomfortable. This is a nice reminder that it can be a good thing- getting comfortable being uncomfortable (and *enjoying* it) is important.

Related to the previous post, thinking through your design and development strategies and writing out the reasoning behind your thinking not only goes a long way for helping yourself think through problems and decisions, having it written out can demonstrate it for potential employers and collaborators!

Google is one of the most competitive interviews out there - even if you don't have aspirations to work at the big G, preparing like you do can go a long way.

And a special shoutout to [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/YoaRRZ), which my partner and I have been laughing about for the last 75 minutes or so.
