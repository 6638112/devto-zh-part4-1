# React - Updating self-dependent state

In React, sometimes we need to update a state value taking into account the current state.

For example, if we are writing a Poll app and we have a button or another component to update the number of votes, we can do something like this:

```
incrementVotes = () => {
  const currentVotes = this.state.votes;
  this.setState({
    votes: currentVotes + 1
  });
}; 
```

The above code could work, but considering that `setState()` is an asynchronous function, a better solution is to send a function to `setState()` as follows:

```
 incrementVotes = () => {
    this.setState(prevState => {
      return {
        votes: prevState.votes + 1
      };
    });
  }; 
```

**Update**

With the first approach, we have the risk that our `state` does not update immediately, for example if our votes count is 10 and we have a user that is too fast clicking the button, we could have two calls to `incrementVotes()` in which the value of `this.state.votes` is the same and in the end we have a final value of 11 when the correct value should be 12.

Maybe there is a thin probability of this occurring but this is a good way of protecting our application of this kind of bugs.
