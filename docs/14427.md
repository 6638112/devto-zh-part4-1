The Big Thread Badge is awarded to the person who creates a discussion thread on the site that sparks the most collective comment love (e.g. score as determined by total ‚ù§Ô∏è reactions and adjacent ranking factors).

This was Matthias's thread:

## Article No Longer Available

Entry is simple: Start a thread that is bound to spark a lot of comments. Ask the community to tell a certain kind of story and get lots of comments! Even if these threads aren't always answering *the deep questions*, they are often great for seeing what the broader community thinks of a topic and are usually a lot of fun!

*DEV employees are not eligible for the Big Thread Badge. üôÇ*

## **The International Streak Continues**

This marks 6/6 winners that have gone to folks from a different country with no winners yet from North America. It highlights the global diversity of our community of folks helping one another out. How long will the streak continue? Oceania, Europe and Africa each have two winners.

## **Happy Coding!**
