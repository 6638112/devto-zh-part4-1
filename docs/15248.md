# Learning F# â€” Web Scraping With F# Data

> åŽŸæ–‡ï¼š[https://dev.to/citizen428/learning-f-web-scraping-with-f-data-3oif](https://dev.to/citizen428/learning-f-web-scraping-with-f-data-3oif)

In my ongoing efforts to learn F# properly, I recently stumbled upon the [F# Data](https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) library, which implements [type providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tutorials/type-providers/) and other useful tools for working with data in CSV, HTML, JSON and XML formats.

To try it out I hacked together a quick `.fsx` script which uses the library's [HTML parser](https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/HtmlParser.html) to scrape the top three F# posts from one of my favorite programming websites, [dev.to](https://dev.to/). Please note that the site **does** have an API, which would be the preferred way of doing this, the following is for demonstration purposes only.

## Simple Scraping

The first step is to reference the downloaded `Fsharp.Data` assembly relative to the script's directory and importing its contents with the [`open` keyword](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/import-declarations-the-open-keyword):

```
#r "fsharp-data/lib/net45/FSharp.Data.dll"

open FSharp.Data 
```

<svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title></svg> <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title></svg>

Next we can use `HtmlDocument.Load` to fetch and parse dev.to's top F# posts page from which we extract the individual articles via the `CssSelect` method and the appropriate [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Selectors):

```
let doc = HtmlDocument.Load("https://dev.to/t/fsharp/top/infinity")
let posts = doc.CssSelect(".single-article") 
```

<svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title></svg> <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title></svg>

We then iterate over the posts, extract the title, author and reaction count and take the top three posts (which are already sorted by number of reactions):

```
let top3 =
    posts
    |> Seq.map(fun post ->
        post |> firstChildText ".content h3",
        post |> firstChildText "h4 > a" |> cleanName,
        post |> firstChildText ".reactions-count .engagement-count-number")
    |> Seq.take 3 
```

<svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title></svg> <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title></svg>

This uses two small helpers, `firstChildText` which is a little convenience function to smooth over the fact that `CssSelect` doesn't yet support the `:fist-child` pseudo-selector, and `cleanName` which removes unnecessary characters around the author's name:

```
let firstChildText selector (post : HtmlNode) =
    post.CssSelect(selector).[0].DirectInnerText().Trim()

let cleanName (name : string) = name.Replace("ãƒ»", "") 
```

<svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title></svg> <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title></svg>

Lastly, we use a simple [`for` loop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/loops-for-in-expression) with pattern matching to output the results:

```
for (title, author, reactions) in top3 do
    printf "\"%s\" (%s): %s\n" title author reactions 
```

<svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title></svg> <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title></svg>

Running this on my Mac with .NET Core produces the following output (which hopefully will include this post in the future ðŸ˜‰):

```
$ fsharpi --exec devto.fsx
"F# for JS Devs" (Jason): 84
"Mere Functional Programming in F#" (Kasey Speakman): 65
"F# is Pretty Cool" (Ben Lovy): 51 
```

<svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title></svg> <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title></svg>

The full script can be found [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/citizen428/2631a265bc6d08db2d6b326f5ecd87b2).

## Asynchronous scraping

After I finished the first version of this script, I thought that this could also be a good opportunity to finally explore F#'s [async programming model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tutorials/asynchronous-and-concurrent-programming/async). So I decided to write a second version which fetches the top posts for F#, Elm, and Haskell, and displays the top five across all three tags. The overall code is quite similar to the previous script, so I'll skip over all the parts I reused. The full script is again available in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/citizen428/212b4396e008c72e44adaf767b8cbb92).

To generate a sequence of the top five posts, the following function is used:

```
let top5 =
    ["fsharp"; "elm"; "haskell"]
    |> getPosts
    |> Seq.collect(fun posts ->
        posts
        |> Seq.map(fun post ->
            post |> firstChildText ".content h3",
            post |> firstChildText "h4 > a" |> cleanName,
            post |> firstChildText ".reactions-count .engagement-count-number"))
    |> Seq.sortBy(fun (_, _, score) -> -(int score))
    |> Seq.take 5 
```

<svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title></svg> <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title></svg>

This invokes the `getPosts` helper, which uses `Async.Parallel` to execute three calls to `fetchTagAsync` in parallel, as well as `Async.RunSynchronously` to wait for all of them to finish:

```
let getPosts tags =
    tags
    |> List.map fetchTagAsync
    |> Async.Parallel
    |> Async.RunSynchronously 
```

<svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title></svg> <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title></svg>

`fetchTagAsync` is relatively simple: inside an [async workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/asynchronous-workflows) it first constructs a URL for the given tag, then uses an asynchronous `let!` binding to wait for the result of the computation, before returning the posts:

```
let fetchTagAsync tag =
    async {
        let url = sprintf "https://dev.to/t/%s/top/infinity" tag
        let! doc = HtmlDocument.AsyncLoad(url)
        return doc.CssSelect(".single-article")
    } 
```

<svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title></svg> <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title></svg>

When executing this it produces the following result:

```
$ fsharpi --exec devto.fsx
"What the heck is polymorphism?" (Jan van BrÃ¼gge): 212
"Tour of an Open-Source Elm SPA" (Richard Feldman): 140
"How I (Finally) Built an App in Elm" (Ali Spittel): 110
"F# for JS Devs" (Jason): 84
"Elm 0.19 brings better collections" (Robin Heggelund Hansen): 78 
```

<svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title></svg> <svg width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title></svg>

## Summary

Despite only having started seriously looking at F# around 2 months ago, I already feel quite productive in it. Its pragmatic support for functional and object programming (but not object-oriented, see Don Syme's talk "[F# Code I Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGLxyyTF3OM)"), as well as the good standard library, make for a pleasant developer experience and the language really lends itself to solving problems in terms of data and transformations.
