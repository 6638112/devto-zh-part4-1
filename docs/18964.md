I love Linux and one thing I love about it is that you can set it up *just right* for yourself to make yourself super productive and make working in Linux very pleasant.

What are your favorite tools to setup and use?

EDIT: I was writing out a list of my own tools and that ended up turning into [a blog post about my favorite linux tools](https://dev.to/antjanus/my-favorite-linux-tools-12be). :)
