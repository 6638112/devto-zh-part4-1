Hi ðŸ‘‹

A well structured and beautiful README is very important, especially for opensource projects. This is the first thing that visitors will see when they discover your project.

This is why I created [readme-md-generator](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator), a tool that generates beautiful basic `README.md` files with less efforts !

All you need to do is answer a few questions, and [readme-md-generator](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator) will do the rest ðŸ‘Œ

`readme-md-generator` is able to read your environment (package.json, git config...) to suggest you default answers during the `README.md` creation process :
