# Custom react hooks vs services

I'm having a tough time explaining the difference between a custom react hook and a service.

It's easy to see the utility of the built in ones, but what about custom hooks?

with a regular service, I can :

*   import it to any component, provide it's functions and or state.
*   call or make use of react hooks.

***When would you write a custom hook and when would you opt for a service?***

***What can you do with a custom hook that you can't do with a service?***
