How do you create a roadmap for the software you're building? What process you follow and what tools do you use? And what exactly do you include in a roadmap? What benefits a roadmap provides?

I want to create a roadmap for the app I'm building and I want to add the feature of creating a roadmap into the app, so I'm looking for suggestions on how do people solves this problem.

Btw if anyone interested what I'm building, it's yet another open sourced project management tool.
