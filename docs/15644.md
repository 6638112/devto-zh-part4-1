When you create a Random object in ruby without an argument the system-generated seed will be applied to that instance. If you pass in an argument of an integer, that integer will be used as the seed value for that Random instance

```
random_w_system_seed = Random.new
random_w_user_seed = Random.new(2330) 
```

Seeding affects the order in which a random generator will put out pseudorandom numbers. If two Random instances have the same seed they will put out the same random numbers in the same order when called.

```
#Here, you can see that the first numbers generated by both 
#instances are the same because they share the same seed
random_same_seed_1 = Random.new(12345)
random_same_seed_2 = Random.new(12345)
random_same_seed_1.rand == random_same_seed_2.rand
# => true

#the same applies for comparing the objects, if they will both generate 
#the same number next, when compared it will evaluate to true
random_same_seed_1 == random_same_seed_2
# => true

#Lets call this first Random instance again so that
#it is one step ahead of the second Random instance
random_same_seed_1.rand
# => 0.3163755545817859

#Now the same seed is not returning the same value because
#the first instance is generating the third number in the
#sequence while the second instance is still generating the 
#second number in the sequence
random_same_seed_1.rand == random_same_seed_2.rand
# => false 
```

Whenever a new Random instance is created without passing in a seed a seed will be passed to it by the system. You can check what this seed is with the #seed method. Additionally, you can set the system seed to a specific number so all Random instances generated without an argument share the same seed. You can do this by calling .srand to set the systems seed for random.

```
#Here, you can get return seeds from Random instances so you can 
#create Random instances with the same seed
random_instance_sys_seed = Random.new
random_instance_sys_seed.seed
# => 124999659906724141071882940163137705973

random_instance_user_seed = Random.new(12345)
random_instance_sys_seed.seed
# => 12345

#Here, you can see that using .srand to set the system seed for rand
#called without a user made instance and the user made Random instance
#have the same return value
random_instance_user_seed.rand
# => 0.9296160928171479

Random.srand(12345)
Random.rand
# => 0.9296160928171479 
```

A class method for Random called .new_seed is what is used to make system seed values if there is no argument given when creating a new Random instance, it can also be called to return arbitrary seeds that are system created.

```
Random.new_seed
# => 32130858170704068723128768018578826042 
```

So whats the point? If you want a random number why do you want to seed? The main reason is so even with pseudorandom returns you can have repeatable outcome from a program. This can be used for testing, debugging, teaching, sharing statistical analyses, or writing academic papers.
