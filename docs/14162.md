## **[ðŸŽµ Repl.it Online Music Hackathon](https://repl.it/talk/challenge)**

This one is a little different from hackathons we've done in the past:

*   We're open to any kind of submission, so long as it's built on Repl.it and incorporates music in some way.
*   We have one stellar judge, Tom Lehman, the CEO of Genius.
*   Most exciting of all: our grand prize is $5,000 (with $2,500 and $1,00 second & third prizes!)

You better get building! We already have some great submissions:

*   [Turn any song into a rhythm game](https://repl.it/talk/challenge/BeatKeeper-Make-a-rhythm-game-out-of-literally-any-song/16433)
*   ðŸ‘‡ [An IDE that plays soothing music while you code](https://repl.it/talk/challenge/Environ-The-Bridge-Between-Music-and-Code/16381)
