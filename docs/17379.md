`<ListView>` was officially deprecated in React Native `0.48`. Sometimes, we ignore deprecation warnings (guilty! 🙈) and don't deal with things until they're officially removed. Do yourself a favor and replace your `<ListView>`s now. It's easy, will improve your app performance, and will clean up your code ( **Read:** No. More. `DataSource`s!).

### My `<ListView>` Component (Puppies! 🐶)

Here’s a simple class component named `<PuppyLitter>` that we will need to update. It takes two props:

1.  `puppies`: An array of objects, one for each puppy in a litter. For example: `[{id: 1, name: 'Winky', age: 2}, {id: 2, name: 'Floofy', age: 1} ]`
2.  `getPuppies()`: A function that fetches an updated puppies array.

It renders a `<ListView>` full of `<PuppyInfo>` components, one for each puppy in the array. A `<PuppyInfo>` will render things such as the puppy's name and date of birth.
