In a time where internet outrage is at its peak, one way to escape this is by mute keywords, hashtags and by using regular expressions.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/) is the only social network I use one a daily basis. I switched to [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) years ago as my primary [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) client and one of the features I miss in the official client are the possibility to mute tweets by regular expressions or by specified clients.

I wanted to write down some regular expressions and muted clients I use in Tweetbot to keep my timeline cleaner.

## Muted tweets by regular expressions

Here are some examples of regular expressions that I mute with Tweetbot.

By default, mentions, searches and lists are not affected by regular expression. But it's possible to enable it for every regular expression.

### I'm not interested in public mentions or conversations

I didn't want to see conversations between other people only because I follow both of them. This regular expressions mute mentions for you also! That means you only see this in your mentions pane.

Mute all tweets beginning with: `@foo`, `.@foo`, `. @foo` or `. @foo`.

`^\s?\.?\s?@`

### Mostly, tweets with more than two #Hashtags are uninteresting

Mute all tweets with more than two hashtags like `foo bar [...] #first #second #third`

`#[^#]+#[^#]+#`

### Tweets with long #hashtags are not really exciting

Mute all tweets with a hashtag that contains more than 15 characters like `foo bar [...] #veryLongHashtag`

`#[^]{15}`

### Bawler

Mute all tweets with more than 2 uppercase words like `YOU'RE SO WRONG`

`(([A-Z]{2,})\s?){3,}`
